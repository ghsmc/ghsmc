        <h1 class="center">Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            In the winter of my junior year, I was slotted into Champ Atlee’s “Advanced Poetry” class, either by the hands of chance or the roly-poly ones that belong to the schedule coordinator, Mr. Fernandez. In the class’ directory I found familiar names, among them Ford Collins, Laney McDowell, DJ Clark, Harry Bylin, and my own brother, Jack. The class started as something of a pressure cooker. Mr. Atlee disregarded the Harkness and Humanities norms and lectured instead, cold calling his students here and there to finish his points and fill in his blanks. Student participation was never the Harkness hodgepodge of empty words, Sparknotes regurgitation, and idioms like “Piggy-backing off of that.” Atlee wouldn’t have that. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I always thought of Mr. Atlee as more of an intellectual than a teacher. He joined Lawrenceville in 1969, and must’ve been the oldest teacher at the school with a decade’s lead. Atlee wore a tweed blazer and embodied what in my mind was the old way of literary scholarship at Lawrenceville. He was well-respected, well-read, and frankly one of the most admirable people I’ve ever met. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Despite the fact that I intercepted him in his later days (he was going on seventy-five probably when I had him), the faculties of his mind were deep and rich with aphorisms, stories, references, jokes, and life lessons, of which he entertained us with only a portion. Mr. Atlee inspired in me a love and a respect for poetry, for the English language, for intelligent discussions, and for teaching. Over the course of the term, Atlee took us chronologically through recent history’s greatest poets, starting with Donne, then Keats, then Dickinson. For each case, we were to write an explication that tracked the poem’s meaning, line by line, as we understood it. The essays I wrote for Atlee were among the best ones I’ve ever written, and so I’ve made an effort of storing them for my future enjoyment.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            And I should share one last note about Atlee, which should help remind you of just who he was. In the last class of each term, he would conclude the course by reciting Brutus’ classic line to Cassius in Act 5 Scene 1 of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar: “Forever, and forever, farewell! If we do meet again, why, we shall smile; If not, why then this parting was well made.”

        <h1>The Fight for Faith: John Donne’s “Batter my Heart, three-personed God”</h1>
        <h2>December 13, 2021</h2>
        <p>
            Have you ever asked God for his guidance, protection, or forgiveness? In John Donne’s “Batter my Heart, three-personed God,” the speaker prays to God with a more extreme request: physical abuse to punish him for his sins. The poem, written in 1610 during a time of religious transformation and artistic renaissance in England, is addressed to God in the form of a prayer. The speaker assumes a demanding tone as he tells God that his Christian heart has been overrun by the Devil, ordering for immediate divine intervention. Structurally, the poem consists of three quatrains and a couplet, written in iambic pentameter. The stanzas are grammatically self-contained, but they are not separated by white space. The first two quatrains follow the ABBA ABBA rhyme pattern expected of a Shakespearean Sonnet, yet the rhyme scheme in the third quatrain and couplet varies, likening the poem to an Italian Sonnet with an octet, turning point (volta), and a sestet. Riddled with paradoxical metaphors and images, the poem conveys the speaker’s internal battle with the Devil as he struggles to preserve his faith in God.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the first quatrain, the speaker opens pleading: “Batter my heart, three-personed God” (Donne, line 1). The three people the speaker refers to together make up the Christian Trinity: The Father, (Christianity’s father figure), the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit (the ethereal notion of God). It remains unclear at this point why the speaker needs such aggressive action— he requests violent and repeated strikes to his heart, as opposed to asking for mercy, blessings, or gentle assistance— which are more common in Christian prayer. The opening line is structured more as a command than a request, and the speaker’s impolite and demanding tone seems puzzling given that he is addressing God himself. The speaker elaborates on his spiritual dilemma, as he feels that God “As yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend” (2). The speaker suggests that his frustration comes from God’s delicate attitude towards him— knocking gently, breathing softly, and shining his spiritual light— in a way that is not belligerent or direct enough to adequately cleanse him of sin or reach his heart. Indeed, the speaker’s attention to the triality of God suggests that each of the three actions, excluding the more general and collective goal of “seek[ing] to mend,” correspond to the three parts of the Holy Trinity (2). In this sense, the diction Donne employs to describe these actions conjures visual images wherein the Father metaphorically knocks on the speaker’s conscience, Jesus Christ breathes the breath of life, and the Holy Spirit radiates spiritual strength. As the poem continues, the speaker specifies the amplified level of aggression he requires: “That I may rise and stand, o’erthrow me” (3). The speaker’s request is paradoxical: how can God help him stand up by knocking him to the ground? By violently pushing him to the floor, God may be punishing the speaker for his sins, transforming him into a more moral and pious man when he stands. Indeed, the word “rise” implies that the speaker is not only physically standing up, but also spiritually ascending. At the end of the first quatrain, the speaker asks God to “bend Your force to break, blow, burn, and make me new” (3-4). This structure of demands one after another parallels the poem’s second line, except the actions are intensified— instead of respectfully knocking to talk to him, the speaker wants the Father to break through with force; instead of gently breathing on him, the speaker wants Jesus Christ to blast him with powerful winds; instead of merely shining a light for him, the speaker wants the Holy Spirit to burn him alive. To save him, however, God must “bend,” his force, pushing the bounds of his powers outside of their usual scope to deal with the severity of the speaker’s situation (3). In other words, the speaker believes he is so deeply entrenched in sin that complete and total demolition is the only way to recuperate his faith in God. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the second quatrain, the speaker compares himself to a “usurped town to another due” (5). Like a town that has been captured by a foreign army, the speaker is powerless and desperate as a force of evil— presumably the Devil— overcomes him. The simile carries connotations of violence and battle, which implies that the speaker’s spiritual struggle is an all-out war. The “town” in this sense could represent the speaker’s heart, which he says “Labor to admit You, but Oh! To no end” (6). Though the speaker works tirelessly to let God into his heart, his efforts are futile— his faith may be altogether irrecoverable. Donne’s use of the word “admit” serves as a double entendre: the speaker struggles not only to receive God into his heart, but also to believe that God is real and true. In this way, the speaker’s prayer becomes paradoxical in and of itself— he calls upon God for assistance, while at the same time contemplating whether God is real at all. As the speaker continues to explain his problem to God, he reveals that “Reason, Your viceroy in me, me should defend” (7). The speaker compares his internal ability to think logically with an official who holds power in a foreign territory on behalf of his supreme ruler, therefore implying that God is not present within the speaker’s soul, but rather that he is ruling it from far away. As the Christian monarch, God has put rationality into the speaker’s mind, tasking it with preserving the speaker’s faith. Though the speaker attempts to defend his rationality at all costs, it “is captived, and proves weak or untrue” (8). The speaker personifies his faith, suggesting that like a prisoner, it is restrained, subdued, and difficult to access. Indeed, by indicating that his faith may also be “untrue” altogether, the speaker reveals his wavering belief in God. The speaker’s connection to God is decaying, as he struggles to defend his faith against the forces of evil overcoming him. Thus emerges the poem’s central image: the speaker’s mind is an active war ground for the clash between reason and irrationality, between good and evil, and between God and the Devil.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the third quatrain, the speaker reassures God that “dearly I love You, and would be lovéd fain,” meaning he would gladly accept God into his heart if he was capable (9). Unfortunately, however, the speaker is “betrothed unto Your enemy”— he struggles to revive his faith because he is engaged to the Devil (10). By indicating that he is engaged but not yet married, the speaker reveals that with God’s assistance, he may be able to turn his struggle with the Devil around and avoid being eternally trapped. The word “betrothed,” which carries notable sexual undertones, paired with the fact that the speaker compares himself to the Devil’s future bride, introduces a metaphor that analogizes the speaker to a virgin woman. The speaker pleads for God to “Divorce me, untie or break that knot again,” hoping that God will break up their relationship and liberate him before he faces permanent imprisonment by the Devil, perhaps an allusion to Hell (11). Donne’s inclusion of the word “again” seems to suggest at first that the speaker has already been engaged to the devil at least once before, as if this is not his first dramatic spiritual episode in which he calls upon God to rescue him. However, the developing sexual imagery in the final lines of the quatrain reveals that the “knot” that the speaker wants God to break is not only the knot of marriage, but also the hymnal knot, the membrane of a woman’s virginity. The speaker is comparing himself to a virgin woman, who must be forcefully penetrated by God in order to be spiritually saved. This woman’s hymnal knot must be broken “again,” because she has already been raped by the Devil. Because the female hymen can actually be broken only once, the speaker’s request is a paradox: the woman that the speaker compares himself to in the metaphor wants God to take her virginity in order to spiritually cleanse her, in the same way that the speaker wants God to overthrow him in order to allow him to stand. In the quatrain’s final line, the speaker insists that God, “Take me to you, imprison me” (12). Because God is not actively present in the speaker’s mind— but rather using rationality as a “viceroy” and ruling it from the outside— the speaker needs God to come closer physically to help him regain his faith. In fact, he feels his situation is so dire that only if God imprisons him can he be safe from spiritual affliction.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the final couplet, the speaker expands upon the ongoing paradox, insisting to God that “Except You enthrall me, never shall be free,” meaning that unless God enslaves him, he will never be liberated from the Devil’s wrath (13). Donne employs both meanings of the word “enthrall,” leaving it unclear whether the speaker wants God reduce him to slavery or to hold his attention through magical spells. The speaker’s current state of spiritual torment is so overbearing that he would prefer to be a slave if it means he can be more pious and reverent. In the poem’s final line, the speaker creates a similar contradiction, telling God he will “Nor ever chaste, except You ravish me,” meaning he can not be pure or virgin unless he is raped by God (14). Whereas the speaker begins the prayer asking for strikes to the heart, he concludes the prayer by asking for God to penetrate him as if he is a virgin woman. The word “ravish” implies bringing someone great delight, but it also denotes forceful and violent action. In the speaker’s eyes, however, such force is necessary to rectify his dire situation. Ironically, only by committing egregious, unholy acts on the speaker — physically abusing him, burning him, and sexually assaulting him  — can God reach his heart, restoring it with faith and making him anew.

            Death Waits for No Man: John Keats’s “When I have fears that I may cease to be”
        </h1>
        <h2>

        </h2>
        <p>
            What if you die before you can do everything you want to during your lifetime? In John Keats’s poem, “When I have fears that I may cease to be,” the speaker is tormented by this notion. The speaker is an ambitious poet — perhaps Keats himself — who hopes to capture the beauty of the natural world in writing and demonstrate the depth of his intellect before his death. The speaker assumes a pessimistic and simultaneously arrogant tone as he worries that he may not have enough time to do so. The poem is fourteen lines, written in iambic pentameter, and adheres to the rhyme scheme of ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, which likens it to a Shakespearean sonnet. However, because the end of the third quatrain runs directly through the final couplet, the final six lines actually make a sestet. Structurally, then, the poem has the skeleton of an Italian sonnet, with an octet, turning point (volta), and a sestet. Although the poem at first appears to be an internal monologue with no addressee, at the poem’s turning point the speaker addresses his lover directly. Written in 1818, just three years before Keats’s tragic death by tuberculosis, the poem is likely based on his own struggle with mortality.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the first quatrain, the speaker opens: “When I have fears that I may cease to be / Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain,” meaning that he often worries that his life will be cut short before he can put all of his thoughts into writing (Keats, lines 1-2). His use of the phrase “cease to be” suggests that he is not necessarily afraid of the act of dying, but rather the concept of simply ceasing to exist. In other words, he fears the implications of death, not death itself. The speaker assumes a rather arrogant and self-centered tone as he insists that a lifetime would not be long enough for him to capture all of the brilliant ideas in his head. The word “glean” can mean both to extract and to harvest, creating a visual image wherein the speaker uses his pen to gather his ideas in the same way that a farmer might harvest wheat with a scythe. Just as the farmer must endure a long milling process to convert his raw grain into edible bread, the speaker will have to refine his raw ideas over time to convert them into comprehensible prose. The word “teem” serves as a double entendre: it means both to be overflowing with and to pour down (describing falling rain). Like raindrops in a rainstorm, the speaker’s ideas are abundant, naturally occurring, and they form one after another in rapid succession. While his ideas may come effortlessly to him (like rainfall), the caveat is that he cannot control when they arrive— the breadth of his intellect is determined by chance. The speaker elaborates on his anxieties, worrying that he will die “Before high-piléd books, in charact’ry, / Hold like rich garners the full ripened grain” (lines 3-4). The speaker employs a simile to expand upon the ongoing metaphor, suggesting that his ideas must be stored in books in the same way that a garner— a granary or storehouse— stores grain. This metaphor reinforces the speaker’s conceited nature, implying that his ideas have the same utility as perhaps the most important source of nutrients for the human race. If his ideas are grain, then “ripened grain” refers to his most matured and developed ones— a process that, like growing crops, takes time and work. Thus, the speaker fears death because it inhibits his ambitions as a writer— death is the deadline by which he must accomplish everything he wants to in his lifetime. 
        </p>
        <p>
        In the second quatrain, the speaker describes the moment, “When I behold, upon the night’s starred face” (line 5). His use of the word “behold,” as opposed to the more simple “see” or “look upon,” implies that he sees the night sky as vast and magnificent. Perhaps the vast nature of the night sky offers the speaker comfort, invalidating his anxieties by reminding him that his life, death, and worries are meaningless when compared to the grand scale of the cosmos. By describing a “starred face” looking back at him, the speaker personifies the night sky, suggesting that it consoles him— or even just interacts with him— in a way that a real, emotional human might. In the next line, the speaker describes “Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,” likely referring to constellations (line 6). Because the speaker compares the night sky to a freckled human face, it appears at first glance as though the speaker feels some sort of romantic connection with the cosmos. However, “romance” can also denote exotic adventures— with this definition, it becomes clear that the speaker is referring to star lore, mythical stories that give meaning to the constellations. These stories are “high” because of the physical position of stars in the sky, but also “high” meaning out of reach for ordinary humans, who will never be able to experience the magic, Gods, and mystical creatures that they describe. The speaker continues, dreading that “I may never live to trace / Their shadows with the magic hand of chance,” meaning he fears he will never be able to translate their beauty into written poetry (lines 7-8).  At first it seems puzzling how one could trace the shadows of the constellations. After all, stars emit light: how could they cast a shadow? Indeed, the seemingly inexplicable shadow cast over the speaker by the cosmos could refer figuratively to his fear of death, as if his anxiety is so oppressive that it hangs over him like a cloud. The speaker may also be employing “shadow” in a metaphorical sense, referring to the effect or impression that the constellations have on him. To trace these shadows, then, would be to express their beauty in verse. But there’s a problem: it’s far too difficult to do on his own. To do so, the speaker needs the magical assistance of the “hand of chance.” Through personification, the speaker invokes a visual image wherein the physical embodiment of chance — some sort of ethereal, otherworldly being — takes the pen from the speaker’s hand and writes what he cannot. Even with divine assistance, however, the speaker can only trace the shadows — he may recreate their general shape and appearance in writing, but he will never be able to translate them exactly as they are. Interestingly, chance seems to both help and hurt the speaker: on the one hand, chance helps the speaker push his expression beyond what he is independently capable of, ultimately helping him fulfill his goals as a writer; on the other hand, the speaker’s death is up to chance, giving him no control over the one event he is most deeply afraid of. 
            
        </p>
        <p>
            At the beginning of the sestet, the speaker addresses his lover: “And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,” and the poem undergoes a turn in structure and thought (line 9). It is initially unclear who exactly the speaker is addressing, especially because up until this point the speaker appears to be talking to himself, addressing no one in particular. Indeed, one might misconstrue the “creature” to be time itself — the speaker describes it as “fair,” because the hour is a consistent, predictable, and unchanging metric of time, and therefore it could be considered impartial. In the next line, however, the speaker clarifies that he fears “That I shall never look upon thee more,” meaning the creature must be a physical person, who the speaker sees as “fair,” meaning beautiful or attractive— he must be referring to his lover (line 10). In this way, the speaker adds a new dimension to his fear of death— he fears not only being unable to fulfill his poetic ambitions, but also leaving his lover behind. For the first time, the speaker expresses a desire to enjoy the human experience, not just to capture its beauty in his poetry. The speaker’s change in attitude is also marked by his use of the word “feel.” He feels the pain of losing his lover, but oddly he does not feel his fear of death, he only has it. This difference is important: the way in which the speaker possesses his fear implies that he carries it as emotional baggage, as a burden weighing on his shoulders. Alternatively, the way in which he feels love implies a deeper emotional experience, one that he is only capable of having because it is a sensation he enjoys and cherishes. But the question remains: why does he describe his lover, probably the individual closest to him, with such a curious term as “creature”? He means to say that his lover is supernatural and otherworldly— if she is the owner of the “night’s starred face” mentioned in the onset of the second quatrain, then the speaker is implying through imagery that their connection is so profound that he actually sees her face staring at him from the cosmos. He cannot simply call her a “maiden” or a “woman,” because to him, she is more than that. Unfortunately, however, his lover is “of an hour”—  the speaker’s fear of his imminent death is so intense that it feels as though he has only an hour left to spend with her. Indeed, by referring to his lover as a “creature of an hour,” as opposed to a “creature of beauty,” the speaker defines her not by her appearance, but by the limited time frame he has with her— he may be unable to enjoy her love in the present moment, because he is too preoccupied with the fact that soon it will be over. In the following lines, the speaker continues: “Never have relish in the fairy power / Of unreflecting love;—” meaning that the speaker fears that after he departs from physical reality, he will never again enjoy the love of his beloved (lines 11-12). Like a fairy, his love is inexplicable, ethereal, and perhaps undying— it cannot be explained, only experienced. The peculiar nature of their connection is reinforced by his choice of the word  “unreflecting,” which can mean both unrequited and thoughtless. The former definition suggests that the speaker needs more time in order to win the love of this “creature.” The ladder definition suggests a more tenable notion: as a poet, the speaker is constantly trying to make sense of the world around him and express its beauty in poetry— because his love is impulsive and without thought, it offers him an escape from his anxieties, allowing him to savor life mindlessly. At the conclusion of the third quatrain, there is a disruptive but intentional abnormality in the poem’s form. The final couplet begins halfway through the twelfth line, ending the stanza prematurely with an abrupt dash, much like death will act as a premature and abrupt end to his relationship with his lover. If the dash represents a sudden end to the speaker’s life, then the last two and a half lines must represent his vision of life after death. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the final couplet, the speaker continues: “then on the shore of the wide world I stand alone” (lines 12-13).  The speaker invokes a visual image wherein he stands on a vast shore, by himself, looking out over the sea. The speaker’s use of the word “then,” paired with the repetition of “When” and “Before” in previous stanzas, builds on the developing sense that time is running out as the poem progresses.  By describing the world on which he stands as “wide,” the speaker emphasizes his isolation; he is completely remote. The natural imagery is both peaceful and disturbing: the beach and open water make for a beautiful landscape, but the speaker’s isolation taints the scene with a certain eeriness, making it seem more desolate than delightful. Here, the speaker will “think / Till love and fame to nothingness do sink,” meaning he will remain in eternal reflection until love and fame lose their importance altogether (lines 13-14). Like ships, people, and items that sink to the bottom of the ocean, love and fame — two facets of life that the speaker used to yearn for — will eventually be entirely forgotten. The word “sink” conjures a kinesthetic image wherein there is a change in physical height — as if the pursuit of love and fame is below him, now that he has died and realized what truly matters.  Before his death, the speaker’s life seems to revolve around achieving his goals before his life ends. After his death, however, the speaker finds comfort in the meaninglessness of life, finally realizing that these things never mattered at all. Like him, they will eventually cease to be. In the end, then, Keats’s “When I have fears that I may cease to be” serves as an existential reminder for its readers: do not spend your life worrying about what you can and cannot do before you die — try to simply enjoy it while you can.

            Don’t Get Your Hopes Up: Emily Dickinson’s “I heard a Fly buzz – when I died”

        <p>
            What do you hope your death will be like? Peaceful? Poetic? In Emily Dickinson’s “I heard a Fly buzz - when I died,” the speaker’s dreadfully disappointing death will surely inspire you to lower your expectations. The speaker’s use of the past tense throughout the poem indicates that she is recounting her death from beyond the grave. Her tone is forceful, dramatic, and ultimately ironic as she narrates her death in spurts of thought, separated by sporadically employed dashes. Structurally, the poem consists of four quatrains, separated by white space but lacking any formal punctuation. The poem’s stanzas alternate between iambic trimeter and iambic tetrameter, adhering to no apparent rhyme scheme. Written in 1862, the poem serves as a satirical criticism of society’s perception of death as a beautiful and inexplicable phenomenon, particularly the Christian notions of death and afterlife that Dickinson was likely subjected to during her lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the first quatrain, the speaker opens: “I heard a Fly buzz – when I died –”  (Dickinson, line 1). The opening line suggests at first that the poem will be a mundane description of a housefly, but after the dash, the poem turns and the speaker reveals that she is recounting her final moments of life. Dickinson’s capitalization of the word “Fly” is curious: why assign significance to such a minute insect? In the following line, the speaker directs her attention towards “The Stillness in the Room,” suggesting that the room in which she died was without any movement or disturbance (line 2). By invoking a visual image of a peaceful bedroom, the speaker emphasizes the disruptive nature of a fly, whose irritating sound and erratic flight directly contrast with the room’s tranquil environment. Furthermore, her capitalization of the word “Room,” implies that it may carry more significance than simply her physical bedroom. Because the speaker is depicting her final moments of life, her “Room” in this context could refer to her internal conscience, where she exists intellectually, but not physically. The speaker elaborates on this room’s atmosphere, insisting that it, “Was like the Stillness in the Air – / Between the Heaves of Storm,” likening the room’s stillness to the temporary intervals of quiet during a raging storm (lines 3-4). A heave denotes both a deep breath and the act of pulling something with great effort. This double entendre produces a visual image wherein some ethereal being — perhaps God — is breathing heavily and exerting great physical force to precipitate and stimulate the storm. Alternatively, the speaker could be referring to her own breathing. If she has pneumonia — a very common condition among dying patients — her lungs are filling with fluid and each inhalation is becoming increasingly difficult. Altogether, the experience amounts to a sort of respiratory “storm.” 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the second quatrain, the speaker expands upon the building visual image of her death bed:  “The Eyes around – had wrung them dry – ” (line 5). The “Eyes” are an example of synecdoche — they act as a stand-in for the loved ones who gather next to the speaker’s bed in her final moments of life. By using the word “around” to describe these eyes, the speaker implies that her family is circled around her, staring at her intently as if waiting to see what will happen when she dies. Because the dash vaguely resembles the shape of a bed, the phrase “Eyes around” is actually crowding the speaker’s deathbed on the page. The resulting image is rather disturbing: the speaker is a sort of spectacle, and while her family is present, there is no indication that she enjoys their company. By reducing these people to their eyes — arguably mankind’s most beautiful and unique feature, and the windows of the soul — perhaps the speaker is suggesting that, in her final moments, she was able to interact with their souls rather than merely their physical selves. Her family members have “wrung” their eyes, meaning that they have cried so much their eyes lack any moisture whatsoever. Wring, meaning to twist something in order to force liquid from it, is a curious choice of diction — crying, an act ordinarily characterized by its unpreventable and unplanned nature, is antithetical to wringing, a task that requires intention, effort, and control.  Perhaps the speaker means to imply that her family members must make an effort to squeeze the tears from their eyes, as if mourning the speaker is a sort of chore. The speaker continues: “And Breaths were gathering firm / For that last Onset,” shifting the focus away from the room’s inhabitants and back towards her deteriorating condition (lines 6-7). She describes feeling a certain solidity or stiffness in her chest as she takes her final breaths. These breaths could carry a religious significance —  in Christianity, the “breath of life” supposedly departs from the human body during death. It’s also important to note that the speaker is not the agent of action — the sentence structure implies that her breaths are gathering independently, without her assistance. By personifying her breaths in this way, the speaker emphasizes her dire condition — in her final moments, her body runs its course separate from her mind in a last-ditch effort to survive. She is not struggling anymore, only her body is — perhaps she has accepted her own death and relinquished control. Indeed, the speaker’s use of the word “firm” implies that in her lungs there has formed a solid, impenetrable wall, one that seems inexplicable considering that the physical properties of air render it both intangible and invisible. The speaker’s description of her final moments as an “Onset,” a military onslaught, conjures an image in which death — in this metaphor, a sort of army — is attacking the speaker. The metaphorical significance of the wall quickly becomes clear: her body is forming a wall of air in the lungs in the same way a kingdom might reinforce its castle walls during a siege. Alternatively, onset can denote a beginning — the dawn of something new. With this definition, the phrase “last Onset” seems rather oxymoronic: perhaps the speaker is suggesting that once she leaves the physical world, she will remain eternally dead; there will be no more beginnings. If the speaker’s final struggle against death is a military conflict, then the word “last,” suggests that this experience represents just one of many of the speaker’s battles against death — each part of a broader conflict that perhaps spans her entire life. All along, however, the speaker knows the eventual outcome: she will be defeated. Life, then, is merely the process of postponing the inevitable. The speaker continues, describing her death as the moment “when the King / Be witnessed — in the Room” (lines 7-8). Her description leaves the reader with several unanswered questions: who is the King? Who gets to witness him? Her use of the word “that,” as opposed to the more personal “my,” suggests that this final struggle against death is a universal human experience. While the speaker expects that the King will be seen, there is no indication that she — or anyone, for that matter — actually sees him. If the speaker believes in the Christian notion that death is a moment where one can interact with the higher power, then the identity of the King becomes clear: God. This interpretation complicates the motives of “The Eyes around”  — perhaps they are staring at the speaker intensely because they too want to see God. On the other hand, the “King” could be the commander of the metaphorical army (death) attacking the speaker. If so, the King must be the personification of death. The speaker’s death, then, is not a moment of spiritual ascension or enlightenment — it is the moment where the Grim Reaper conquers her, consigning her to an eternal state of inexistence.

        In the third quatrain, the speaker continues: “I willed my Keepsakes,” meaning she has signed her will, leaving small mementos — or perhaps all of her material possessions — behind (line 9). “Will” serves as a double entendre, denoting both to sign a legal document that expresses how one’s property will be distributed after death, and to make something happen by exercising mental powers. Dickinson’s diction suggests that she is not only legally giving away her possessions, but also willing them — transforming them — into “Keepsakes.” Because the poem’s setting is presumably inside the speaker’s bedroom, her prized possessions are likely all around her. So long as the speaker is alive, however, these “Keepsakes'' are not keepsakes at all — the speaker must die before they can be used to remember her life. Thus, the speaker must convert them into mementos that her loved ones will use to remember her, in anticipation of her forthcoming death. The speaker elaborates: “Signed away / What portion of me be / Assignable –” (lines 9-11). In other words, by signing her will, the speaker has permanently abandoned some undetermined fragment of her identity.  If the speaker is referring to the “Keepsakes'' mentioned in the previous line, then she sees her possessions as a part of her existence — but one that she has accepted she must leave behind. The speaker’s use of the word “away” conjures a kinesthetic image wherein the speaker is physically moving away from these objects, therefore implying that after her death, she has been entirely disconnected from the material world. Because “portion” denotes a part of a whole, the speaker implies that there are at least some elements of her existence that she will keep after death, begging the question: what will she get to hold onto? Perhaps she will maintain the more transcendental, non-physical parts of her existence: namely, her conscience, intellect, and morals. Indeed, the speaker’s ability to articulate her transition from life to death demonstrates that she maintains a high level of cognitive ability, even beyond the grave. On the one hand, her perspective is hopeful — she ceases to be on a physical level, but not on an intellectual one. Only a “portion” of her dies; not all is lost. On the other hand, by defining the components of her existence into those that are “Assignable,” or transferable, and those that are not, the speaker categorizes human life in a definitive, black and white way. The resulting implication is rather morbid: humans are merely the sum of their parts. Also worth noting is the speaker’s shift in tense — the speaker has lost not the portion that was “Assignable,” but rather the one that be “Assignable.”  This implies that this fragment of her identity — her possessions — persists. If the speaker sees her belongings as an extension of her physical form, then perhaps she finds some comfort in the fact that they will be cherished and preserved in the physical realm from which she is now otherwise disconnected. She may never interact with her loved ones again — but at least her “Keepsakes'' will. Having prepared her will and accepted her forthcoming death, the speaker appears at peace with her circumstances. A sudden dash, however, suddenly interrupts the flow of the poem, and the speaker continues: “– and then it was / There interposed a Fly -” (line 12). The speaker’s use of the phrase “and then” contributes to the developing sequence of time in the poem — after she has officially relinquished her ties to the material world, the event that should logically follow is her death. Instead, it is the long-forgotten fly from the first quatrain who “interposes,” meaning both to make an interjection (via words or noises) and to insert oneself between two parties, and interrupts the speaker’s final moments. The former definition suggests that the fly’s buzzing interferes with the speaker’s perception of reality, consuming her hearing, blocking the voices of her loved ones, and disrupting the room’s stillness. The latter definition implies that the fly is intervening between the speaker and another, ambiguous party — perhaps the King or her family. Suddenly, the speaker’s experience shifts from a tranquil and accepting death to a frustrating and imperfect one. Dickinson's use of enjambment builds a dramatic sense of suspense, making the arrival of the small, buzzing fly all the more ironic.

            In the fourth quatrain, the speaker elaborates on the fly: “With Blue – uncertain stumbling Buzz –” (line 13). By characterizing the fly’s buzzing as the color “Blue,” a color associated with the ocean and the sky, the speaker synesthetically associates the fly with serenity and relaxation. If the speaker is gazing out of her bedroom window, perhaps she sees a blue sky. The speaker must be experiencing a sort of synesthetic blending of her hearing and vision as she drifts out of consciousness, explaining the presence of blue tones. By describing the buzz as “uncertain,” the speaker personifies the noise, implying that it is doubtful and indefinite — perhaps the fly is the physical manifestation of the speaker’s internal incertitude. Alternatively, the noise may be “uncertain” because as the speaker drifts out of consciousness, her senses become too unreliable for her to corroborate whether the fly is real or merely a figment of her imagination. The speaker also characterizes the buzzing noise as “stumbling,” implying that it is unstable and faltering — audibly going in and out. The sense of choppiness and swift change created by the repeated use of dashes mimics the erratic movement of a fly. Also worth noting is that the alliteration of “Blue” and “Buzz,” allows for the capital “B” to actually stumble from one side of the page to the other. The speaker continues, specifying that the buzzing interposes “Between the light – and me –” (line 14). The presence of sunlight in the speaker’s bedroom confirms that she is indeed peering out a window. The spiritual connotations of light must also be examined. In the Bible, light acts as a symbol of holiness and grace — Jesus Christ even proclaims himself “the light of the world” (John 8:12). If the light carries a more spiritual significance, then the speaker may be referring to the Christian understanding of death, in which one supposedly hears the voice of Christ before meeting him and ascending to heaven. But alas, no spiritual figures speak to her — all she hears is the buzzing of a fly. In this way, Dickinson uses the speaker’s experience to mock the Christian understanding of death. This is furthered by Dickinson’s choice to capitalize the “F” in “Fly” but to keep the “l” in “light” lowercase, attributing more significance to an insect than to a holy symbol. The hyphen that separates “light” and “and me,” appears as a small black smudge on the page, almost resembling a fly. Again, Dickinson’s ability to subtly transpose the meaning of her lines into their punctuation and form is worth appreciating. The speaker continues: “And then the Windows failed.” By describing her bedroom windows as ceasing to work at all, Dickinson conjures a visual image in which the speaker’s reality is collapsing in her final moments of life. If the windows also represent the speaker’s eyes, then their failure implies that she has lost her sense of vision altogether. The speaker concludes the poem: “and then / I could not see to see – ” (lines 15-16). The final phrase, “see to see,” suggests that her vision is doubly impaired — not only is she unable to see with her eyes, but there also exists nothing for her to see after her death. Christ never arrives to escort the speaker to heaven, and his voice never echoes in her ears as promised by the Bible. On the page, all that follows the speaker’s death is a vast expanse of white space. For the speaker, there is no afterlife — only eternal nothingness. While many hope for a peaceful and poetic death, Dickinson’s “I heard a Fly buzz - when I died” depicts just the opposite: the speaker spends her final moments fixating on the petty annoyance of a fly, and finds nothing spectacular awaiting her on the other side. In the end, then, the poem advises readers to lower their expectations: like life, death is disappointing and imperfect.
