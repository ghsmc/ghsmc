    <p>
        Welcome to my first blog post. As I write this, the date is Wednesday, May 26, 2021. The time is 7:36 PM. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm beyond excited about this website. I like the look of it, but it may just be because it's novel. The terminal style looks sort of cool; it also looks like a website a 12 year-old wanna-be "hacker" would build. But who cares? I like it.
    </p>

    <p>
        As I write this, I'm sitting in my dorm room. It's pouring rain out. Because this is the first blog post I've ever written on this site— or, in general, for that matter — I think I should probably talk about how and why I built the site. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I built this site because I thought it was time I should have a portfolio website of my own. It's a fun project that doesn't involve too much work on the back-end. It's just design — and I like design. It isn't built beautifully. It doesn't look <i>beautiful</i> either. I like the simplicity. I built it with raw HTML and CSS, no framework. I originally forked the terminal typer JS from a repo on GitHub called CodeNerve. The idea was for me to just play around with it, but it inspired me to start this website out of it.
    </p>

    <p>
        At first, the entire index was typed, start to finish. It took forever for everything to come in across the screen, plus it didn't look great when it was finished. When you reloaded, it did it all over again. I decided I would only make one element on the site typed: the nav on the homepage. I figure that if you're visiting other pages, you've already seen it. You don't want to see it again. It's also much nicer because you can navigate between pages quickly, without having to wait for the typing animation to slowly give you the options to move about web pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        I can justify keeping the cool animation on the site by putting it in the Nav of the index. I figure that it forces the visitors to read the small blurbs about me as they wait for it to load. Otherwise, you won't see that animation anywhere else on the site. 
    </p>

    <p>
        So this is it. This is the first post. Eventually, I'll probably have to delete these posts, but for now I don't mind them. I'll definiately archive them when the time comes to make the portfolio site actually professional. For now, it's fun to just look back at them.
    </p>

   <p>
       Signing off. The time is 7:47 PM.
