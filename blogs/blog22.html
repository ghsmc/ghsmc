        <hr>

        <p>
            The date is July 5. The time is 2:17:53 PM.
        </p>
        On every profile on Github — the social network and colloborative tool for programmers — there exists a calendar
        that shows how often one codes. For each day that you code, that day is marked green. Depending on how many
        "commits," or contributions, you make to your projects, the color of the green changes. A deeper green signifies
        less commits. But a glaring lime green is the result of many commits.

        <p>

        <p>
            Beyond just building a bunch of cool projects, which I'm just starting to get into, one of my goals for the
            summer was consistency. My older brother, Miles, has a near perfect calendar. He's coded everyday for months
            — maybe years. My goal was to create what I call the "Sea of Green." I wanted everyday, for at least two months (July and August) to be nice and green.
        </p>

        <p>
            Realistically, it doesn't hold any signifcance. Nothing will happen to me if I achieve that goal, other than personal satisfaction. No one at Github will reward me. My profile might look a little cooler, and I'll feel good about myself. This blog, in reality, has become the best way of doing that. A daily blog is a daily commit. If I blog everyday for these two months, well, I'll have the Sea of Green I always wanted. As stupid as it sounds, commiting to a goal like this one is important for me — it helps me realize that despite how little what I do in each day feels, in the long run it will show. Even if it shows in an ugly, glaring, lime-green color.
