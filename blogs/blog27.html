        <hr>

        <p>
            The time is 3:42:45 PM. The date is Sunday, July 18. I'm in Long Island.
        </p>

        <p>
            Welcome back. It's been a while. Everything is good.
        </p>

        <p>
            To start, I want to address something I've been thinking a lot about in terms of this blog. I haven't
            blogged in a while, and each day that I didn't get the time or the will power to crank one of these out I felt a tang of guilt. If I missed days, how would I complete my already over-ambitious 100 BLOG goal?
        </p>

        <p>
            But I realized that while setting goals for myself is good, this blog isn't the best place for me to direct that energy. It makes me feel productive to write one of these blogs, but in some sense I'm not actually being productive— the work that I'm doing is not bringing me closer to my broader, overarching goals in computer science. So, I've arrived at the conclusion to get rid of the 100 Blog goal. I believe I should blog when I want, how I want, and about what I want. It's stupid to write blogs for the sake of writing them. When I reflect and read through these in a couple years, I want to be able to read actually interesting content, not just my morning to-do list. For the few, occasional readers that come by, I don't want them to have to read that either.
        </p>

        <p>
            So here's my revised goal: <i>Write interesting blogs.</i> 
        </p>

        <p>
            That was a long but necessary foreword. Today's blog is about my Welles Research. I've come along way, but the process is not over yet. I have a lot of stuff that I still have to do, but the end finally feels in sight. I finally feel like I can do this. This morning, I ran a test on some sample data — a part of the financial disclosure data from senator Pat Roberts (A Republican, Kansas Senator who retired in January of this year). 
        </p>

        <p>
            The data analysis is not complete, but so far, I've found that his purchases in 2020 returned a staggering 28.8% while his sales lagged behind with a return of 19.84%. His portfolio is worth around $2,642,500. His returns smashed The Dow (which returned 7.3%). He performed signifcantly better than the S&P 500 Index, which returned 16.3%. Roberts lost to the Nasdaq composite, which returned 43.60% in 2020.  
        </p>

        <p>
            I found these results very interesting. Roberts is somewhat of a daytrader— there were myriad occassions when he bought a stock one day and sold it the next. He also bought a few stocks that traded at below $5. Some of his best purchases in 2020 were Amazon, NVIDIA, and Apple. Although I haven't yet reviewed all of his transactions from 2020, I did check around February, January, and March to see his trades in and around COVID-19. It was during this period that some of his colleagues in the senate used their informational advantages to dump large positions before the market tanked; he actually had very few trades during this time, and they didn't seem related to any of the briefings (i.e., buying biotech companies, online telecommunications, or online shopping companies).
        </p>

        <p>
            Signing off. The time is 4:05:48 PM. I hope you enjoyed this one.
        </p>
