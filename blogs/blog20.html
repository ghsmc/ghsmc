        <hr>

        <p>
            The date is Saturday, July 3. The time is 1:36:42 PM.

            If it's any sign of my productivity, the lock feature is up and running. You probably saw that when you came to visit this blog. I've decided that any blogs I make following updates to the site should not be locked. I made this choice for two reasons: 1) none of the information in these blogs is deeply personal or private; 2) if I didn't leave them unlocked, I'm not sure there would be any unlocked posts. I wouldn't feel good about that — then my blog isn't a blog, it's just me writing letters to the few who know the password.
        </p>

        <p>
            It looks good though, and it was surprisingly easy. I like building this site over time. It's really fun to just add another feature when I have an idea. It's a work in progress. And it will be, probably forever. That's all. I've got a lot of stuff to do.

           Signing off. The time is 1:39:35 PM.
