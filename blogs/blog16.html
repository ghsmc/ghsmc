    <p class="captionblog">A Quick Update</p>
    <hr>

    <p>
        The time is 3:10:05 PM. The date is July 1. I'm in Long Island, New York.
    </p>

    <p>
        I don't have anything interesting to say. Not right now, at least. I thought I'd just give a general update — not every blog post has to be an interesting take, right?
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm working on Python stuff. I'm just getting into it, but it's already becoming one of my favorite langauges. The Spotify Project, mentioned in my previous blog post, is sort of a mini warm-up process for me to get comfortable with Pyython. I'm really excited about it. I'm using a Library management framework called Flask. This allows me to build websites in html and css, within python. Very cool.   
    </p>

    <p>
        In other news, I have to start my summer reading. I also want to play soccer today, though it looks like it's raining outside right now. At least it'll be cooler out if I do play. I need to get my sleep schedule back on track — I woke up at 1 PM today. Not good.
    </p>

    <p>
        Andrew Yang conceded the election; so much for my phonebanking efforts. Eric Adams looks like he'll be the next New York City mayor. I act mad, but I'm not. I'm indifferent. It really doesn't impact me in any important ways. After all, I practically live in New Jersey.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm gonna make another blog post directly after this one about music. I've found some new songs and artists that I really like.
    </p>

        Signing off. The time is 3:16:09 PM.
