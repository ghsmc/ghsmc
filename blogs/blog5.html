    <p class="captionblog">Disney & Capitalism</p>
    <hr>

      The date is Saturday, May 29. The time is 6:01:23 PM. I don't have much time — definately not enough to say anything worthwile about a topic as consequential as the one I want to talk about. But that's alright. No one's grading this.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe that despite its implications, capitalism has good intentions. In theory, it offers everyone an opportunity to be wealth — incentives to be rich are incentives to be innovative. Consumers ar free to choose the products they desire. But the best evidence to support capitalism is because its better than alternatives. Although it may have some downsides, there are no economic systems that — in practice — work better. You might be thinking now of the Nordic Model: the staple counterargument. Yet in these countries, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, you won't find socialism. You'll find free market capitalism, with unions and perhaps a larger magnitude of state power over the most important facets of soceity: mail, rail transport, airlines. 
    </p>

    <p>
       The economic system (excluding Norway, perhaps) is characterized by competetive capitalism. In 2013, <i>The Economist</i> defined these countries as "stout free-traders who resist the temptation to intervene even to protect iconic companies." It is undeniable that these countries have high degrees of state participation with generous welfare programs and public healthcare systems. But these countries also have stock markets. The Nordic labor market is flexible. They possess, in essence, the defining characteristics of capitalism.
    </p>

        But capitalism is not all good. It encourages innovation, but also ruthless greed. Some argue that these play into human nature. I'm not really sure; it is undeniable, though, that capitalism disparages people, sometimes illuminating the uglier side of mankind.  
    </p>

    <p> 
       Disney is a perfect example. Just last year, they pleged $5 Million to support nonprofit organizations, including the NAACP, "to further their longstanding work promoting social justice by eliminating disparities and racial discrimination through their advocacy and education programs." Like other major companies, Disney is riddled with "equity training" for its employees. Just this month, they announced a new plan called "Reimagine Tomorrow," encouraging their employees to recognize their white privilege, to understand and fight against system racism and white fragility, and to reflect on America's racist infastructure. I'm all for programs like these — I think it's great that major countries are taking action against the racial inequities that plague American soceity. Unfortunately, though, it's all a ruse: a hollow stratagem to stay afloat and competitive in an increasingly progressive world.

    <p>
        Believe it or not, this is most clear when you look at Disney's Chinese movie posters. Why? See for yourself.
