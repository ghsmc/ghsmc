    <p class="captionblog">A Cool Idea</p>
    <hr>

    <p>The time is 5:40 PM. The date is June 29, 2021. </p>

    <p>
        Another day, another blog. Consistency is good, but not required. I'm in New York City, going in between VS-Code and Rust. Life is great.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm writing this blog to talk about a cool project idea. I'm a little bored, I've got a little too much time on my hands, and I'm with one of my friends who also codes. What better to do than build a project?
    </p>

    <p>
        If you've ever played the <a href="https://higherlowergame.com">Higher Lower Game,</a> it should be pretty simple to understand. Our project relies on the Spotify API. The idea is that the user will be prompted with two albums that they (hopefully) know. Knowing the albums makes the game more fun, no doubt. Then, they'll have to guess which is more popular. 
    </p>

    <p>
        This blog is password protected because the project isn't yet complete. Until it is, I don't feel great about releasing the project's idea to the internet, even if no one visits my site. A few other things for today: I've got to double check that I implemented shynet correctly because so far I've received 0 data. That is, no one has visited the site. I know this is false because, well, I've visited the site. If I want to continue the whole comment box idea, I'll have to redesign it to fit with the sites theme. I also have a few housekeeping things with Stance. One of these days I'll design a mobile format, and send out some emails. Otherwise, I'm working on Welles, trying to be as productive as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        I want to have this Spotify project -- I'm calling it "TopAlbum" -- done by tonight. I'll probably write another blog to update as I get closer to that goal. It's good for my 100 blog goal, which mathematically cannot be achieved without more than a blog a day. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Signing off. The time is 5:48 PM.
