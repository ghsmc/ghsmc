        The time is 11:04:46 AM. The date is Friday, June 4.

    <p>I haven't posted for a while on here. My previous blog posts have required at least 20-30 minutes, mainly because I like to make them interesting. But I think this platform should also enable me to make brief, short updates. I want to be able to contribute to the Blog without having to do in-depth research or dive into a discussion. </p>

    <p>
        It's reading day at Lawrenceville. I've got a bit of time on my hands. So I'm just writing this to say I'm getting crushed out here. I've got a ton to do. But I'm also so desensitized to stress that I no longer am worried by deadlines or assingments. I have a guarenteed, undying assurance in me that whatever happens, I'll get my shit done. But sometimes I won't be able to blog, code, or play soccer as much. I just gotta accept that.
