    <p class="captionblog">The "A"</p>
    <hr>

    <p>
        The date is Friday, May 28. The time is 8:11:13 AM. 
    </p>

    <p>
        This post will be brief. If too many of them are too short, I may add a new "tweet-like" element to this blog. I'll just have to see how it evolves. Today's post is about the "A."
    </p>

    <p>
        The "A" is among the most predominant forces at Lawrenceville. It keeps us in our rooms, studying, even when being outside sounds — and is, frankly — much better. It compels us to talk to our teachers — sometimes for good, real reasons, and other times for artificial, grade-boosting purposes, and, rarely, because you like the teacher and the teacher likes you.
    </p>

    <p>
        The competetive nature of Lawrenceville is not ruthless, it is subtle. There is also an overwhelming sense of helplessness among students. In this little world, our fates lie in our grades and the fate of our grades lie in our teacher's hands. Hard work and a dedicated commitment to the "grind" work to some uncertain extent, but there is a universal sentiment on campus that your teachers determine your outcomes. And it is true — a line up of easy teachers is a line up of easy classes, which is a line up of good grades. 
    </p>

    <p>
        But this interpretation misses the point: if you work hard enough, you can earn an "A." This is the difference between "getting an A" and "making an A." The former implies an ominous beholder above who must make a choice of whether or not to give you an "A," somewhat independent of the work you have done. It implies outside forces. But "making an A," a phrase I don't hear from anyone other than my Southern grandfather, implies that the outcome is a direct consequence of the worker — of the maker. It indicates that an "A" is not given, but earned.
    </p>

    <p>
        But I also must consider that these are among the best problems to have. While many around the world struggle for survival, I struggle to get "A's" each term. And that's why, given my position and the trivial nature of the problems that possess my existece at school, I ought to <i>make</i> A's.
