    <p class="captionblog">Loss</p>
    <hr>

    <p>
        The time is May 27, 9:02:04 AM. It's Thursday. I'm sitting in my dorm room, in my Judaism class right now. We're learning about mourning and death. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I thought I should probably devote one of these posts to loss — that is, losing someone close to you. I should say death. It's hard to be direct. I guess we're trained to use euphemisms to describe death: "he's not with us, anymore"; "he's moved on," and so on and so forth. The truth is that we have no idea what happens after death. We can subscribe to various belief systems to comfort us. I don't want to get too personal. I know I'm my only reader — but it still doesn't feel right. Here goes.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we apply Buddhist ideas of reincarnation, death doesn't seem so bad. We have millions of lives. Each life is only one, trivial, and impermanent experience. If we force ourselves to believe this, death no longer represents a perpetual change in our lives. Instead, it's a transformative and even positive experience, in which our loved one loses his life but, as these ideas compel us to hope, he moves onto another better one. We'll just see them in the next life. No problem. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Perhaps the reason that religious idealogies devote so much effort to matters of loss are because life and death are, for the most part, religious things. We come full circle. Across the board of religious variety, almost all of us associate some religious ceremonies with birth — circumcision, baptism, promises to God of the baby's faith. In the end, we are buried in a coffin and given a service with prayers, a eulogy, a rite of committal, and so on. These are Christian traditions, but this is true of other faiths too. Lawrenceville's Rabbi, my Judaism teacher, tells me so as I write this post.  
    </p>

    <p>
        With loss, my biggest fear is not feeling. I am observing my emotional turbulence more now than ever, largely because I want to know how — or even if — I react to death. I guess death makes one feel dissociated. Waking you up to the insignificance of the world while stripping the motivation from the now-trivial things in our lives that we once though matter. Why write an essay on the International Monetary Fund's role in Zambia during the 1980s African financial crisis? Who cares? There are bigger and more important things to worry about. But being so enveloped into a singular frame of thought puts power into these sort of inconsequential things. As a student, these things are our lives.
    </p>

    <p>
        But a sudden death — or even an expected one — wake us up. We realize the agency in the cliché: tommorow is not promised. The most painful thing is that the world goes on. We watch the clouds move and the leaves fall from the trees. We see the people bustling, entrenched into their own lives just as much as we were moments before our loss. I've found that death is messy. It's not a clean fight. You don't just "overcome" it like any other challenge. It justs slowly becomes a part of you. If you think about it for long enough, maybe your mind become desensitized. We never forget about the person we've lost. Their existence is just a blurred memory, making random and sporadic appearences in our minds.  
    </p>

    <p>
        This post is severely inconclusive. But so is death. I suppose I'll end this post by pushing the bounds of my sentimentality.

                <i>And when that happens, I know it. A message saying so merely confirms a piece of news some secret vein had already received, severing from me an irreplacable part of myself, letting it loose like a kite on a broken string. That is why, walking across a school campus on this particular December morning, I keep searching the sky. As if I expected to see, rather like hearts, a lost pair of kits hurrying towards heaven. </i>
