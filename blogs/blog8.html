    The time is 10:11:55 PM. The date is Tuesday, June 8. Feeling great. 
    </p>

   <p>
       To the future me reading this, the time between this blog and the previous blog has been an absolute grind. I've just finished ten page paper on the IMF in Zambia. I turned in an essay on Emily Dickinson's "They Shut me up in Prose." I took a sit-down, 2-hour, cumulative math test. I took a Spanish exam this morning. It's been fun, honestly. My work doesn't feel rigirous when I do it around my friends, and the freedom of finals is generous. Otherwise, I'm preparing for the summer: organizing my goals, my projects, and my things. 
   </p>

   <p>
       But now, I'm done. It's over. It's a surreal feeling, really. Everything I've done in the last year is wrapped up nicely; Nothing left for me to do — all tests taken, essays turned in, homework completed. I'm underwhelmed. Maybe I was expecting an instant liberation, a blissful escape from the grind. But I haven't had that yet. The moment one problem dissapears, another consumes the mind.
   </p>

   <p>
        I thought the last post left things inconclusively. This one clarifies it. Feeling great, though I haven't really processed what it means that I have nothing left. I'm excited to see how everythinng goes this summer. 
   </p>

   <p>
        I love the clarity these posts give my mind, even if I'm just talking to myself. Expect more posts this summer, but don't expect consistency. I won't demand that of myself. I think any deadlines, constraints on my expression, or requirements for cosnistent posting contradict the purpose of this blog altogether. No need for that here — I get my good fix at Lawrenceville.

       Signing off on Blog 8. It's 10:20:56 PM.
