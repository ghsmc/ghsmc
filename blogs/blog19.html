        <hr>

        <p>
            The date is Saturday, July 3. The time is 12:37:25 PM.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a pretty early blog. I've technically already made a blog today, because "yesterday's" blog came at
            nearly 1 AM last night. I don't have much to say today, but I thought I'd give a general update. Maybe a few
            more songs. I have to say that these updates are more for me than they are for the reader. They just help me
            get organized.
        </p>

        <p>
            I don't want to just write my to-do list down here. That's not good. I want to finish the front end for my
            spotify project, "TopAlbum," today. I want to add a small feature to the blog that puts a locked icon on the
            blogs that are locked on the blog.html page. I think that'd be clean. I also want to check my shynet
            implementation; I still haven't gotten around to that yet. These are just housekeeping stuff.
        </p>

        <p>
            I want to crank out a few pages of research for my Welles Project, focusing mainly on the 2020 insider
            trading scandal and previous studies. The research process is coming along, slowly. I've got a few other
            things to do. I want to start the Code it Forward curriculum in the next few days, and also send out some
            emails for Stance. Summer reading too — Yikes.
        </p>

        <p>
            That's a lot. But if I can get it done, I will feel really satisfied and productive. We'll see. I'll write
            another blog post tonight, for one because I want to give an update on my progress, and for two, because
            mathematically I need to be cranking out at least two blogs a day to get to my 100 BLOG goal.
        </p>

        <p>
            Time to get going. The time is 12:45:05 PM. I should probably be waking up earlier. Signing off.
        </p>
