    <p class="captionblog">Productivity</p>


    <hr>

    <p>
        The time is 4:04 PM. The date is June 28, 2021. I'm in New York City.
    </p>

    <p>
        I've been feeling pretty good. I think I'm making good use of the free time that I have. I'm working on my Welles Project mainly. That might dominate the blogs for the days and weeks to come.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of my favorite feelings is feeling productive. That feeling that you could just do anything. It's like when you're writing an essay, and there are those little parts when it just becomes effortless. No revisions necessary, no sentence-by-sentence struggle.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's the feeling of typing really quickly and not making any errors. It's a sensation that can be quickly shot down. Just 10 or 15 minutes lazily scrolling in bed will kill it. It's the mindset that every five-minute or ten-minute interval of your day can be and should be used. And when they all are used, you feel really good about yourself. But there's a difference between being productive and feeling productive-- though they do go hand in hand. I feel highly productive when I write these blog posts. They're conclusive and deeply material. I can sit down for 15 minutes, rambling, and then get the rewarding satisfaction of having another blog up on my site. Some of these are hollow, full of completely empty words back to back to back. Like this one.
    </p>

    <p>
        But that's alright. These are for me mainly, and there is no one grading them for substance. I'll sign off now; it's been just five minutes, but I feel a sense of accomplishment. I love that. I almost forgot-- I wanted to talk about my goals for the blog. I want 100 blogs for the summer. There's no real reason, but I think it'd be sort of cool. I'll try to do it whenever I can. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Signing off. The time is 4:10 PM. I'll go to play soccer or lift soon.
    </p>
