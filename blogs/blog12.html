        <p class="captionblog">New Features</p>
        <hr>

        <p>
            The time is 6:31 PM. The date is June 27, 2021. I'm back in New York City. Hanging out with John.
        </p>

        <p>
            The wifi's been down for the last two days, so I haven't been able to do much. But it just returned, and so
            I
            decided to sit down and crank out (even though my implementation is a bit janky) a feature I've wanted to do
            for
            a while now. Eventually, I'll clean it up. No alerts or prompts. Those tend to give an unprofessional vibe.
            But
            then again, this site isn't exactly professional.
        </p>

        <p>
            I should probably clear up what the actual feature is. It's a password lock system. In hindsight, some of
            these
            blogs shouldn't, in my opinion, be public access -- that is, I don't want random people to read them. To
            clarify, the
            system isn't exactly fullproof. Someone with any decent experience could figure out the password, or read
            the
            blogs without even knowing it.
        </p>

        <p>
            But I don't really care that much. If you're a friend (who reads, and they're are few), just text me and
            I'll
            let you know the password. Not all of them will be locked. Not all of them need to be. I like making posts
            about
            updates to the site like this one so that I have a log of when I did everything. GitHub works for that too.
            I'm thinking about adding a comment section. I'll test it out on this post.
        </p>

        <p>
            Signing off. The time is 6:38 PM. That was quick.
        </p>
