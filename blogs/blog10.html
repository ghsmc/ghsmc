    <p class="captionblog">The Summer Mindset</p>
    <hr>

    <p>
        The time is 6:28:52 PM. The date is Sunday, June 13.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm on my MacBook — you can tell from the seconds in the time stamp — but I'm not in New York City. I'm in
        Harbor Island, Bahamas on a boat called the <i>Inspiration.</i> It's really great. I'm glad to be here for the tenth blog.
    </p>

    <p>
        Looking out onto blue waters, my biggest problems are what to bathing suit to take to the beach and what movie
        to watch tonight. We're whipping jet skis around the bay at our own whim. Being here made me realize I should
        devote at least one these posts to the <b>summer mindset.</b> The state of mind in which we, as students, are
        completely disconnected from the stress and work of school life.
    </p>

    <p>
        Getting into the summer mindset takes some time. Even after you leave school, the school doesn't leave you. When
        you come out of finals week, you're mind is temporarily consumed by the work that possessed your existence for
        the days prior. But with enough distractions, we forget about it all. And then our normal, stress, rapid-firing
        school state of mind is replaced by a mindset of perpetual relaxation.
    </p>

    <p>
        There's nothing to worry about. Soon, we become unconscious of how great life is. Only when summer creeps up on
        the fall term do we recognize what the summer mindset was. In our final days, there's no returning to this state
        of mind. We've lost it — and we can only earn it again by living through another seven months of on-and-off
        school.
    </p>

    <p>
        You may be thinking that this post should be titled "the break mindset." But as a student, the summer mindset is
        a distinct and unachievable during the brief spring and winter breaks. They are not far removed enough from the
        school to forget entirely what it feels like to be in school.
    </p>

    <p>
        I want to be aware of the summer mindset. I want to relish in it. The boat is moving off the dock as we speak. I
        can see it through the small windows of my bedroom. Life is good: Exhibit A.
    </p>

        <i>I'm more of the, trips to Florida</i>
        <i>Order the h'orderves, views of the water,</i>
        <i>Straight from the page of your favorite author,</i>
        <i> And the weather so breezy,</i>
        <i> <b>Man why can't life always be this easy</b></i>
