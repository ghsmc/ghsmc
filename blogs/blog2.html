    <p class="captionblog">College Culture</p>
    <hr>

    <p>
      The time is 8:57 PM, on Wednesday, May 26. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I go to a boarding school in New Jersey called the Lawrenceville School. It's great — I love it. But I'm not devoting an entire post to talking about why I love Lawrenceville so much. That'll come. Later.
    </p>

    <p>
      For now, I want to talk about the problem with Lawrenceville: college culture. Each day there my inbox overflows with {All Stu} emails that detail a new club or publication on campus. A Business Publication! A Sports Publication! A philospohy publication! This is the promise of Lawrenceville — it exists among a select few other prestigious boarding schools in which students will absolutely find a place that revolve around their interests in campus life. It just feels hollow. 
    </p>

    <p>
      A long time ago, I think, Lawrenceville was a different place. From what I've heard, attending Lawrenceville was a guarenteed exchange: for a steep tuition — a great education and a guarenteed place at an elite college. A spot in the trifecta: Harvard, Yale, Princeton. I guess many parents still believe it's well worth the price, even if it only guarentees a spot in the sweet sixteen. On the one hand, this seems like a good thing. Top schools are more diverse in their acceptances; consequently, Lawrenceville's elitism dissipates — other people now have opportunities to find a place in an elite college, too. Everybody wins? Not Lawrenceville.
    </p>

    <p>
      You're probably looking at the screen a little puzzled. Of course Lawrenceville doesn't win here — that's the whole point. It's a more equitable enviornment in terms of the transition from high school to college. But there's another reason why Lawrenceville loses here. It's culture endures a powerful evolution. Its students are less authentic. Many of them, I think, are less oriented towards finding their true passions. Instead, they take on clubs. They make publications. They do everything in their power to craft a perfect college application.
    </p>

    <p>
      And you can't blame them for this. After all, they just want to go to a good school. And even though I refer to this crowd ominously as "they," I am deep among them. When students of a much older Lawrenceville were virtually guarenteed a spot at a top college, they weren't worried about finding leadership roles in order to cater to the college application process. They just did what they were interested in. It was much more authentic.  
    </p>

    <p>
      I love Lawrenceville. But I wish that during our brief time here my world didn't revolve around the instituions outside of Lawrenceville's gates. I wish they revolved around this one. 
    </p>

      Signing off. The time is 9:12 PM.
