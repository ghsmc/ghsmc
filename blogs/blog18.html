        <hr>

        <p>
            The date is Saturday, July 3. The time is 12:32:43 AM. I'm in Long Island.
        </p>

        <p>
            The past few blogs have been completely boring. They've also been locked. It's high time for a meaningful,
            free post. Not that anyone's reading this. I take that back — if this gets too deep or personal, I will not
            hesitate to lock it.
        </p>

        <p>
            I want to talk about happiness. I had a really good conversation with one of my friends the other night. We were sitting on the roof of my house in New York City, looking at all the buildings and the stars. We talked about how insigificant our lifetimes are. Our existence as a whole is a miniscule speck in a vast expanse of time. When we die, we are forgotten; there is no fighting that. We are programmed, to some degree, I think, as the result of actual evolution, to believe we matter. This prolongs our life. We are conscious enough of our tiny importance enough to discuss it but rarely enough to believe it.
        </p>

        <p>
            And that makes sense. Imagine if all of a sudden, humanity as a whole stepped back and took on a nihilistic world view. They would neglect their jobs — why work a rigirous, soul-sucking 9-5 job? It doesn't matter. They might desert their families and marriages if there not happy in them. Institutions would collapse. Cops, excluding the few who actually derive deep fulfillment from serving justice and upholding the law, would probably quit. There would be chaos.
        </p>

        <p>
            Realistically, we came to the conclusion that one should pursue individual happiness at all costs. Now, I will not practice what I preach —  I would never start skipping school just because I would derive more happiness from doing so; I would never let go of the fundamental aspects of my life, even if deserting them may bring me more happiness. Why? I don't know. I just can't plausibly pursue happiness at all costs. Jordan Peterson argues that life is simply a matter of avoiding suffering. Yet under the pretense that we will all die and be forgotten, that no matter what we do, our existence is useless and meaningless, life should be a matter of chasing happiness. And to some degree, those two are sort of synonymous.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even if I can't, for whatever reason, follow this route, I believe there are other ways to maximize my happiness without sacrificing the things that matter to me (and they don't really matter, this is just me being an irrational human). Always be looking forward to something. Always be working on something that makes you proud. Always be chasing something (goals, in some form of money, accomplishments, fame, it doesn't matter). Otherwise, you just have to hope you have good brain chemistry. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The direction of this post has sort've gone awry. I think I'll lock it. That system, upon second analysis, is  more secure than I first though. And I'll probably come back to it, too. But it's getting late. I'll wrap it up here.
        </p>

            Signing off. The time is 12:48:50 AM.
