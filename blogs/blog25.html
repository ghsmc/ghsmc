        <hr>


        <p>
            The date is Friday, July 9. The time is 9:37 AM. I'm in New York City.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's been thunderstorming in New York City-- heavy rain, lightning, winds, thunder. Besides being unable to go play soccer or workout, it's actually really nice. There's something special about sitting inside, dry and comfortable and warm, as the outside world becomes terribly harsh and cold. It really motivates me. Sitting at my desk, looking out my window at everything. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Today's blog is devoted to a project that is going to really make up my summer: my Welles project. It's an investigative study into the stock returns of U.S. senators in 2020. I've been just focusing on the research paper aspect right now-- that is, cranking out research and background information, but that's beginning to slow me down tremendously. Even when I hit my completion deadlines, I still feel like I haven't made very much progress. Why? Because the primary component of the project is actual coding. 
        </p>

        <p>
            So I've reworked my deadlines. Now, it's all about coding. The data analysis will come out as I create an online dashboard. It will also be used in my research paper, which, as I'm realizing, is not the most interesting or important part of the project. I've got a great vision for it. More to come. Also, I need to figure out how to host with Flask. Netlify doesn't work. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Signing off, for now. I think I'll write another blog today, it's one of those kind of days. The time is 9:43 AM.
        </p>
