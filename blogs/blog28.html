        <hr>

        <p>
            The time is 4:20:39 PM. The date is Friday, July 23. I'm in Long Island.

            I've got a really good setup going out here. All of the time spent working is spent working on my Welles Project. I'm really enjoying it, but it's certainly the most ambitious coding task I've ever started on.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unfortunately, I don't have the time or idea to write a very interesting blog today. I'll that this one is for is to say: I'm going to make a Memento Mori Calendar. It's that calendar that relegates each little square to a week. And then you can visualize how much actual life you have left to live. It supposed to be really motivating, and it's supposed to help you stop procrastining, see the bigger picture, and focus on what matters most. I was going to buy one, but I thought hey, wouldn't it be better if I just coded it and added it to this website? At least, I'm going to try to make one. And it's not going to be widely accessible, but if you read this blog, you'll know where to find it. <b>Go to gmccain.com/mementomori.html
    
            </b>

        <p>
            It may never show up there— if I never figure out how to do it. But we'll have to see. Signing off. The time is 4:24:25 PM.
