        <p class="captionblog">Discreet or Overt? Morals in a Good Story</p>
        <hr>

        <p>
            The time is 2:18:33 PM. THe date is Sunday, July 11. I'm in New York City.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today's blog is about good storytelling — better yet, it's about the delivery of morals. It doesn't always
            have to be in a story. Sometimes it is, but there are other places — music, art, nature, even observation of
            everyday life.
        </p>

        <p>
            But in all of these moral vehicles, there is a varying degree of glare; that is, how much the morals stand
            out and how easy they are to understand. There's an entire genre of YouTube videos that exist at the apex of
            glaring morals — videos with beautiful production, great casting, pretty good writing, but ethical lessons
            that stand out so far they just ruin it all. From channnels like Dhar Mann and Omeleto come a story about a
            man who cheats on his wife and then realizes what he's lost and taken for granted; A film about a girl who
            cheats on her test and in the end, doesn't have enough understanding of the material to apply it to her
            everyday life when she needs it most. Incredibly straightforward morals, almost like low-hanging fruits. But
            they aren't good. No, it's not that simple. Good stories are written by good authors who consciously reward
            good readers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes the morals are muddled and hard to find. But that's the beauty. It takes time and thought to
            unpack them, and even if you finally do, you still won't feel 100% certain that your intepretation of the
            message is right. Take Tobias Wolff's <i>Old School,</i> where a school boy navigates everyday life. Wrapped
            into the story are morals about judging a book by its cover, anti-semitism, the significance of life, but
            they are not incoporated into each and every bit of description annd dialogue. It takes a conscious reader
            to read between the lines to get there.
        </p>

        <p>
            Or James Baldwin's short story, <i>Sonny's Blues.</i> It's a really incredible story, and its laiden with
            meaningful messages about coping with suffering, beauty derived from pain, and free expression of one's own
            past. Not only are the morals more complex, but they are also not sitting in plain site. You have to study
            the dialogue between Sonny and the narrator before you can understand why it is that the narrator is so
            judgemental of Sonny's obsession with pianos. You have to spend time to understand the dynamic between the
            narrator and his brother in the story if you want to really get the morals within it. And that's the amazing
            thing — That once you get there, you have rewarding realizations with elaborate, likely original messages
            that you actually apply to your everyday.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's not always literature. Movies can have the same profound effect when you consider films like Shawshank
            Redemption, Life of Pi, Inception, and others of this genre. Packed with deep and great meaning that can
            only be discovered and enjoyed by a watcher conscious enough to look for them.
        </p>

        <p>
            The beauty doesn't come from exclusively the morals. The same exists in music. The equivalent relationship
            is true: Omeleto films is to Sonny's Blues as Joyner Lucas is to Kendrick Lamar. If you're not familiar with
            Joyner Lucas, he's a very gifted musician that makes music with very overt morals. Other African American
            hip hop artists may weave their fight against oppression into their lyrics subtly, but Lucas takes a
            different approach. Consider his widely popular song "I'm Not Racist." The music video literally features a
            white Trump supporter and a black (presumed) democrat rapping in each other's faces, before ultimately
            reconciling their differences. The moral could not be clearer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Don't get me wrong, it's a good song. And it's true. But I hate that there's no work to be done for the
            listener. To contrast that, take Kendrick Lamar's "The Blacker the Berry" on his magnum opus, <i>To Pimp a
                Butterfly.</i> It arrives at a similiar message — his personal struggle with racism and its implications
            for African Americans in general. But it gets there in a different way. He tells a story about losing a
            close friend to gun violence. Just listen to his interview with MTV.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
            "A few people think it's just talk and it's just rap; no, these are my experiences," he told MTV News on
            Tuesday when he sat to break down TPAB tracks at the W New York – Downtown. "When I say, 'Gang banging made
            me killer a n---a blacker than me,' this is my life that I'm talking about. I'm not saying you, you might
            not even be from the streets.

            "I'm not speaking to the community, I'm not speaking of the community," he continued. "I am the community."

            Lamar says that his music is therapy, and listening to Butterfly suggests that the good kid from the mad
            city needed a lot of it. On "u" -- the album's most emotional track -- Kendrick admits that he faced
            depression and thought of suicide after the murder of a close friend. After that murder, K. Dot fantasized
            of getting revenge, but instead he poured his angst into "The Blacker the Berry."
        </p>

        <p>
            This is the difference. Good authors and musicians reward good readers and listeners with more elaborate
            morals. They're delivered in a beautiful way. And even if they're harder to find, in the end, they're much better.
        </p>

            Signing off. THe time is 2:45 PM. This was a long one.
