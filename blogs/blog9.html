    <p class="captionblog">The Summer Mindset</p>
    <hr>

    <p>
    The time is 6:28:52 PM. The date is Sunday, June 13.

    I'm on my MacBook — you can tell from the seconds in the time stamp — but I'm not in New York City. I'm in Harbor Island, Bahamas on a boat called the <i>Inspiration.</i> It's really great.
    </p>

    <p>
        Looking out onto blue waters, my biggest problems are what to bathing suit to take to the beach and what movie to watch tonight. We're whipping jet skis around the bay at our own whim. Being here made me realize I should devote at least one these posts to the <b>summer mindset.</b> The state of mind in which we, as students, are completely disconnected from the stress and work of school life. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Getting into the summer mindset takes some time. Even after you leave school, the school doesn't leave you. When you come out of finals week, you're mind is temporarily consumed by the work that possessed your existence for the days prior. But with enough distractions, we forget about it all. And then our normal, stress, rapid-firing school state of mind is replaced by a mindset of perpetual relaxation.
    </p>

    <p>
        There's nothing to worry about. Soon, we become unconscious of how great life is. Only when summer creeps up on the fall term do we recognize what the summer mindset was. In our final days, there's no returning to this state of mind. We've lost it — and we can only earn it again by living through another seven months of on-and-off school. 
    </p>

    <p>
        You may be thinking that this post should be titled "the break mindset." But as a student, the summer mindset is a distinct and unachievable during the brief spring and winter breaks. They are not far removed enough from the school to forget entirely what it feels like to be in school. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I want to be aware of the summer mindset. I want to relish in it. The boat is moving off the dock as we speak. I can see it through the small windows of my bedroom. Life is good: Exhibit A.

        Kanye West says it best: 
   
        <div class="quote">
            <i>I'm more of the, trips to Florida</i>
            <i>Order the h'orderves, views of the water,</i>
            <i>Straight from the page of your favorite author,</i>
            <i> And the weather so breezy,</i>
            <i> <b>Man why can't life always be this easy</b></i>

        If you're an observant reader — a creepily observant reader — you would've noticed something slightly different about the time stamp on this post. It's missing seconds. My Apple laptop displays seconds, but my windows PC doesn't. I'm back home, in New York City.
    </p>

    <p>
        I suppose I could probably fiddle with my system preferences to fix that. But I like it. It's a little hint to indicate where I'm writing from.

        Being home is absolutely amazing. The size of the shower, the comfort of the bathroom, the luxury of eating whenever I'm hungry. Seeing my family again, petting my dogs, sleeping in my own bed. All of it.
    </p>

        But now that I've left the day-in, day-out grind environment of Lawrenceville, I realize it wasn't so bad. When you're immersed deeply in your studies, it's hard to recognize just how great life is. But when those days are over —  when all of our work-related problems are allleviated — I have some time to reflect. I realize that I'll miss the fulfillment of finishing the day's work each Lawrenceville night. I realize that I'll miss the early mornings; that I'll miss the nights where I went to bed knowing I'd get well under eight hours of sleep. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Don't get me wrong, I love being home. A lot of Lawrenceville's grind is not so fun: tests are stressful, essays are long and difficult, and classes can be boring and aggrivating in their attempts for "fruitful" discussion. But being in New York makes me appreciate the things that I couldn't while I experienced them. I'll miss Lawrenceville, but nine hours of sleep are nice. I'll be just fine here.
