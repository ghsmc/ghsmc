            The time is 7:49 PM. The date is June 10, 2021.

            If you're an observant reader — a creepily observant reader — you would've noticed something slightly
            different about the time stamp on this post. It's missing seconds. My Apple laptop displays seconds, but my
            windows PC doesn't. I'm back home, in New York City.
        </p>

        <p>
            I suppose I could probably fiddle with my system preferences to fix that. But I like it. It's a little hint
            to indicate where I'm writing from.

            Being home is absolutely amazing. The size of the shower, the comfort of the bathroom, the luxury of eating
            whenever I'm hungry. Seeing my family again, petting my dogs, sleeping in my own bed. All of it.
        </p>


        <p>
            But now that I've left the day-in, day-out grind environment of Lawrenceville, I realize it wasn't so bad.
            When you're immersed deeply in your studies, it's hard to recognize just how great life is. But when those
            days are over — when all of our work-related problems are allleviated — I have some time to reflect. I
            realize that I'll miss the fulfillment of finishing the day's work each Lawrenceville night. I realize that
            I'll miss the early mornings; that I'll miss the nights where I went to bed knowing I'd get well under eight
            hours of sleep.
        </p>

        <p>
            Don't get me wrong, I love being home. A lot of Lawrenceville's grind is not so fun: tests are stressful,
            essays are long and difficult, and classes can be boring and aggrivating in their attempts for "fruitful"
            discussion. But being in New York makes me appreciate the things that I couldn't while I experienced them.
            I'll miss Lawrenceville, but nine hours of sleep are nice. I'll be just fine here.
        </p>

            Signing off. The time is now 8:10 PM. We're headed to Bergamote.
