    <b class="title1">HELLO</b>
    <p class="p">Hi — I'm George McCain. I'm a full-stack web developer interested in politics, diplomacy, systems of government, tech policy, and finance. My work revolves around using technology to bring transparency, accountability, and representation to these areas.</p>

    <b class="title2">CURRENTLY</b>
    <p class="p">Right now, I'm a sophomore at The Lawrenceville School, a boarding school in New Jersey. Here, I participate in various organizations around campus that aim to use technology to better understand and improve the world. I'll graduate in 2023. I'm originally from Manhattan, New York City.
    
    </p>

    <b class="title3">PROJECTS</b>
    <p class="p"s>Each of my projects is different in execution, but the same in intention: to bring transparency, accessbility, representation, or accountability to politics. Along the way, I've picked up some programming skills in Java, JavaScript, and Python. To build websites, I use HTML and CSS, often with the help of a framework like Boostrap, Tailwind, or a17t. Some of the projects I've done are <i>Stance</i>, <i>Eval</i>, and <i>DailyWisdom.</i> You can check them out in my portfolio.
