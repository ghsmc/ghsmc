        <h2>August 29 - Four hours until landing</h2>
        <p>The time so far has gone by quickly, and I have not been watching the clock. The man next to me is Patrick, he is in his late twenties, and works for a defense contractor on classified quantum computing techniques. I am curious and ask him about quantum entanglement. I remember Nathaniel‚Äôs Dad, Bill, once explained it to me simply like this: Ronit has red high heels. When I go into her closet, I see only one of the shoes, and the other shoe is not there. I know that the other shoe must be elsewhere because the singular shoe is there. This is like how electrons behave. When they are not observed, they behave as both a particle and a wave. This is what the double slit experiment shows you. But when they are observed, or there is any energy which enters the system, the electron acts as either particle or wave. But before you look at it it is in both places at once. This is the superposition.</p>
        <p>It makes me wonder whether there is an end to science, or a limit to how far science can take us in our understanding of reality. The scientist wants to know what the world is made up of, so he studies it, but in a way that makes him apart from it. And then he divides a substance into molecules, molecules into atoms, and an atom into electrons, protons, and neutrons, and then finally he has it! The electron. But then if fundamental form, matter, is electrons, and they are in two places at once, and change when they are observed, then how could they really be there? There is something else maybe he is missing in his understanding. Maybe because the electrons do strange things when he is aware of them, that is what he is missing in his understanding. Himself. I don‚Äôt know man, this is Dax talk.</p>
        <p>I land in Japan in an hour. I text Emma and I have never texted anybody like this before. Listening to the Rolling Stones and Kanye West and I think about going to a Jazz club. I will be a pilgrim for four weeks and a monk for two, and I will gain nothing, and make no progress, if I succeed. If there is a lofty spiritual conquest in my mind, then there is expectation, and this is not right practice.</p>
        <p>I had a dream a couple of weeks ago. I met a sage after swimming down a river in Arizona, chasing some pro triathlete down the stream. It was a woman. Then she scaled the cliff and rock climbed and sped toward wherever she was going. And I stopped and there was a sage, a small stocky black guy with a robe and a gray beard and gentle eyes. He said with a smile that I would have to abandon my ideas of right and wrong if I wanted to preserve my peace and face the challenges ahead. In the following weeks, I went to the hospital for five days with an infection in Siena. My aunt Janie passed away. The sage was right‚Ä¶ or maybe all I can say is that he was there.</p>
        <p>Now nearing landing, with a turbulent spilled coffee and a plate of scrambled eggs and a croissant beside a single serving butter, I do not know if there is such a thing as right practice, or wrong practice. And that is right practice.</p>
        <p>I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm hungry. I‚Äôm flying over Japan, and when I look out the window, I wonder: what is this place? It is perfectly flat, squared by fields of shades of green, and it looks like a minecraft world. I see forests and rice fields, red and white towers, and a train unlike any I have seen before. Now it is real. Now I am here.</p>

        <h2>August 29 - Three hours into the flight</h2>
        <p>When I remember how I can speak about Buddhism and Zen especially when I am trying to make Mom or Jack feel better I cringe at how I can speak and be sometimes. I told Mom before I left for Japan that soon, I would shut up. This is because of the Chinese saying, he who speaks does not know, and he who knows does not speak. I understand but I do not understand.</p>
        <p>It is like the first koan in my practice with Mr. Jordan, my teacher. The student says to the master, ‚Äúthe voices of torrents flow from the same great tongue. The lines of the hills are the breathing body of Buddha. Isn‚Äôt that right?‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúWell, yes,‚Äù says the master. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs a pity to say so.‚Äù I want to convey what I know to my friends and family, because I love them. But in trying to convey what I know I know nothing. In speaking of it, I lose it. By thinking about it, I stand over it, apart from it. How could it be put into words? Maybe it could, maybe not. Maybe the right words will point you to it if you have right effort, right orientation, and right practice. But to speak of Buddha-nature as something lofty and grand is not right practice. It is perfectly ordinary. It is you. This is my way of studying myself.</p>
        <p>My Mom wants me to keep a journal for her of her humor. Things like ‚ÄúGuys, today I had to eat a fish eyeball.‚Äù And she joked with me to give that to her here and write the lofty bullshit over there. Okay, but maybe I should not write any lofty bullshit. Maybe I will just write about ordinary things like trees, and walking, and tea. But at least I will write about something everyday and express myself truly. And my family and friends will know I am safe and what I am doing.</p>

        <h2>August 29 - Before Japan</h2>
        <p>I sit on the airplane and talk to Kazuma. He seems fond of Shikoku, and he speaks clearly about what he liked about it, and what to expect. Temples who give stamps, locals who give little gifts. Like a cold rainy morning a Japanese trucker stopped on the side of the road and gave him a hot tea. He said it brightened his day. Everybody looks out for you in Shikoku.</p>
        <p>The plane rolls forward and I hang up the phone. I look out the window and we speed up and leave the ground and there is a floaty feeling in my stomach. I have a Kindle full of books and a window with a vacant middle seat to my left. Everything is straightforward and I am comfortable and happy.</p>
        <p>I see New York City and we climb into the clouds and the blue tinted wing with the water and city behind it fade into the clouds until I can‚Äôt see anything at all. Then the plane flies above the clouds and there is an endless bed of white pillows extending in all directions. I think about how I am flying and how I am sitting on a seat in the sky.</p>
        <p>I have to pee badly and there is a small Japanese lady sitting in the flight attendant seat fidgeting and moving around a lot. I sit still but wherever you are even if it‚Äôs the rolling hills of Tuscany or drifting above the clouds to Japan if you feel like your bladder is gonna burst it sucks. I have my neck pillow and not my solar charger and I get up to take a piss and eat some food from the airport.</p>

        <h2>August 27 - Sitting in the Highline Hotel</h2>
        <p>Emma says it looks like somewhere women are not allowed. I laugh and get Mom and latte and we sit by a gleaming red truck in a hotel courtyard in Chelsea. She is unhappy but she says she has no problems and I am there and with her and I worry about her and want her to be present and this takes me away. What do I know really?</p>
        <p>I tell her about Emma and Spannocchia and what I learned. Cutting wood and making fires, and making some pasta and liking thinking and being myself. I miss Ardian and my girlfriend. We go down to the water and into a market on the pier and I have a Caesar salad which is okay and we walk around and talk about Miles and his new girlfriend.</p>
        <p>I see on Mom‚Äôs phone pictures of his new apartment and his room is colorful and geometric. He is happy with it but Mom and I think it is a little bit ugly and weird. It is not our room but I wonder if he is really happy with it or if he could see it as I see it without the excitement of having his own apartment and his own bedroom and being all grown up.</p>
        <p>We walk home and I go for a run through the city and I feel strong especially in my mind even though I am not as fit. I am happy.</p>
        <p>I smoke a joint on the roof and look out at the skyscrapers and the dark clocktower behind me with the orange circle and the Google fortress. My eyes are warm and red and they feel at home with heavy eyelids looking at this view. I call Emma and she reminds me how even though everybody in my family goes in different directions we all go through it together. She cheers me up and I love her and I sleep like a stone.
