    <b class="title1">HELLO</b>
    <p class="p">Hi — I'm George McCain. I'm a full-stack web developer interested in diplomacy, politics, tech policy, and finance. I'm fascinated by the intersections between technology and politics — and by how technology can be used to promote accountability and representation around the globe.</p>

    <b class="title2">CURRENTLY</b>
    <p class="p">Right now, I'm a sophomore at The Lawrenceville School, a boarding school in New Jersey. Here, I participate in various organizations around campus that aim to use technology to better understand and improve the world. I'm originally from Manhattan, New York City.
    
    </p>

    <b class="title3">PROJECTS</b>
    <p class="p"s>Although each project is different, all of my projects are intended to bring transparency, representation, accountability, or accessibility to the world of politics. Along the way, I've picked up some programming skills in Java, JavaScript, and Python. For Web Development, I use HTML and CSS, often with the help of a framework like Boostrap, Tailwind, or a17t. Some of the projects I've done are <i>Stance</i>, <i>Eval</i>, and <i>DailyWisdom.</i> You can check them out in my portfolio.
