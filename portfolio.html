    <p class="captionportfolio">This is where my projects live.</p>


    <div class="projectdiv">
      <span class="projectname"><span>SenateTrades</span><span class="text-gray"> — What stocks are your senators buying?</span>
      <span class="click"><a href="https://senatetrades.org/">Check it Out</a></span></span>
      <p class="projectexp">SenateTrades is dedicated to holding public officers financially accountable. Our website promotes financial transparency by processing their stock market transactions and compiling their portfolios in an accessible and digestible format for the American public. </p>
    </div>


    <div class="projectdiv">
      <span class="projectname"><span>TopAlbum</span><span class="text-gray"> —Which album is more popular? (not yet hosted)</span>
      <span class="click"><a href="/">Check it Out</a></span></span>
      <p class="projectexp">TopAlbum (2021) is a project I built along with my friend John McGarry as a game to test music-lovers' understanding of popularity. The user is given to albums, and they must decide which is more popular — your score will climb as you get them right, but once your wrong your back to 0. How high can you go? It relies on data from the Spotify API, a tool that developers have used to build hundreds of fantastic projects and the code is all open source on Github. The site is built with Python, Flask, HTML, and minimal Javascript.</p>

    <div class="projectdiv">
      <span class="projectname"><span>Stance</span><span class="text-gray"> — How do legislators represent
          you?</span><span class="click"><a href="https://www.stanceproject.org">Check it Out</a></span></span>
      <p class="projectexp">Stance (2021) helps you understand who is representing you without tedious research. We’ve
        done the hard work for you. After you take a short political survey that covers flagship issues, we use an
        algorithm to compare your responses to the beliefs of U.S. senators. Based on that data, we can calculate how
        well each senator represents you on a ten-point scale.</p>

    <div class="projectdiv">
      <span class="projectname"><span>Eval</span><span class="text-gray"> — Stock Market evaluation, made
          easy</span><span class="click"><a href="https://ghsmc.github.io/eval/">Check it Out</a></span></span>
      <p class="projectexp">Eval is a web app I developed in the summer of 2020 designed to make stock market tools more
        accessible to everyday investors. The service allows users to enter a ticker symbol of their choice and then
        they are able to see the instrinsic valuation for the corresponding stock, giving them valubale information for
        making investment descisions. </p>

          day</span><span class="click"><a href="https://ghsmc.github.io/dailywisdom/">Check it Out</a></span></span>
      <p class="projectexp">DailyWisdom is a project I developed in the summer of 2020. It's mission is simple:
        displaying a wise, interesting quote everyday (or every refresh). Daily Wisdom draws from an API of famous
        quotes. It is one of my first ever projects.</p>
